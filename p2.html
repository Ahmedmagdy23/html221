  <tr>
    <th>Open issue</th>
    <th>Brief description of the cause</th>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Standards</td>
    <td>There are several standardization efforts but they are not integrated in a comprehensive framework</td>
    <
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td> Mobility support</td>
    <td>There are several proposals for object addressing but none for mobility support in the IoT scenario,
	where scalability and adaptability to heterogeneous technologies represent crucial problems</td>
    <
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Naming</td>
    <td>Object Name Servers (ONS) are needed to map a reference to a description of a specific object and the 
	related identifier, and vice versa</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Transport protocol</td>
    <td>Existing transport protocols fail in the IoT scenarios since their connection setup and congestion control
mechanisms may be useless; furthermore, they require excessive buffering to be implemented in objects</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Traffic characterization
and QoS support</td>
    <td>The IoT will generate data traffic with patterns that are expected to be significantly different from those
observed in the current Internet. Accordingly, it will also be necessary to define new QoS requirements
and support schemes</td>
    
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Authentication</td>
    <td>Authentication is difficult in the IoT as it requires appropriate authentication infrastructures that will
not be available in IoT scenarios. Furthermore, things have scarce resources when compared to current
communication and computing devices. Also man-in-the-middle attack is a serious problem</td>
    
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Data integrity</td>
    <td>This is usually ensured by protecting data with passwords. However, the password lengths supported by
IoT technologies are in most cases too short to provide strong levels of protection</td>
    
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Privacy</td>
    <td>A lot of private information about a person can be collected without the person being aware. Control on
the diffusion of all such information is impossible with current techniques</td>
    
  </tr>
   <tr>
    <td>Digital forgetting</td>
    <td>All the information collected about a person by the IoT may be retained indefinitely as the cost of
storage decreases. Also data mining techniques can be used to easily retrieve any information even after
several years</td>
