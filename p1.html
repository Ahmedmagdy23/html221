 The Internet of Things (IoT) is a novel paradigm that is
 rapidly gaining ground in the scenario of modern wireless
 telecommunications. The basic idea of this concept is the
 pervasive presence around us of a variety of things or
 objects – such as Radio-Frequency IDentification (RFID)
 tags, sensors, actuators, mobile phones, etc. – which,
 through unique addressing schemes, are able to interact
 with each other and cooperate with their neighbors to
 reach common goals.<br/>
 Unquestionably, the main strength of the IoT idea is the
 high impact it will have on several aspects of everyday-life
 and behavior of potential users
