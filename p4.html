<p style="font-size:20px;" >The Internet of Things (IoT) is the internetworking of physical devices, vehicles and other 
objects which consists of an embedded system with sensors, actuators and network 
connectivity that enable to collect and exchange data. The IoT allows objects to be sensed 
and/or controlled remotely across existing network infrastructure, creating opportunities for 
more integration of the physical world into computer-based systems, and result in 
improved accuracy, efficiency and economic benefit. The IoT is a rapidly increasing and 
promising technology which becomes more and more present in our everyday lives.Furthermore, the technology is an instance of the more general class of cyber-physical 
systems, which also encompasses technologies such as smart grids, smart homes and 
smart cities. Considering the high-rate development of IoT technologies, and the 
significant increment in the number of the connected devices, comprehensive overview of 
the IoT system aims, architecture, challenges, applications, protocols, and market 
overview were discussed. </p>
